# Changelog

All notable changes to Sentinel. Each section below is ready to copy-paste into a
GitHub Release. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

---

## v0.3.1

**Open-core positioning, landing page, and polish.**

- Open-core model: `PRO.md` (commercial offering) + a Free-vs-Pro table; README and
  PITCH explain the split (Core is free/Apache-2.0, Pro is convenience + extras).
- README now leads with the product pitch, then flows into the docs; `PITCH.md` is the
  standalone one-pager.
- `demo.sh` showcase + a "See it run" section with real captured output.
- GitHub badges (license, language, release, stars/forks/issues, "no dependencies",
  "100% local").
- `assets/tui.svg` + `assets/gui.svg` interface mockups.

## v0.3.0

**Adam optimizer, model tiers, retrieval over CVE/malware/OSINT, GUI + TUI.**

- **Adam optimizer** (m + v moments, bias correction) replaces Adagrad; persisted in the
  checkpoint. The model now produces coherent text instead of character soup.
- **Three build tiers from one source** (size knobs are `-D`-overridable):
  `make slm` (~1.2M params, 27 MB) · `make` (~58M, ~1.9 GB, **plain gcc**) ·
  `make huge` (~101M, ~3.2 GB, `-mcmodel=large`).
- **Retrieval (RAG)** generalized to **CVE / malware / OSINT** topics; greps a local
  corpus, with **live internet** CVE-id lookup via `SLM_ONLINE=1`. `fetch_corpus.sh` adds
  malware + OSINT sources.
- **Web GUI** (`--serve`, localhost-only HTTP server, pure C) and **TUI** (`--tui`).
- Cleaner retrieval output (skips badge/blank lines).

## v0.2.0

**Deeper/bigger network, real-world data, fan-out, hardening, packaging.**

- Stacked multi-layer network with a learned embedding; scaled-up parameters.
- **Data consolidation:** `--train` accepts files *and* directories (recursively folded
  into one corpus). `fetch_corpus.sh` pulls high-starred security/coding repos + CVE data.
- **Difficulty-tiered sub-agent fan-out:** `FANOUT: <n>` spawns up to 100 concurrent
  agents, each sized to task difficulty (light/medium/heavy).
- **CVE lookup agent** that greps the corpus for real vulnerability writeups.
- **Security hardening:** non-truncating command guard, expanded denylist, unique
  `mkdtemp` temp dirs for the coding agent, shell-input validation.
- Apache-2.0 license, `Makefile`, `start.sh` launcher, built-in `--help`, SVG logo.

## v0.1.0

**Initial release — a self-contained Small Language Model in pure C.**

- Character-level tokenizer, static weight matrices, hand-written matrix multiply.
- Recurrent network with hidden-state feedback (no fixed token-context window),
  trained by backprop-through-time; checkpoint persistence + online learning.
- Sub-agent layer: a `TASK:` trigger `fork()`/`exec()`s a separate process; hard safety
  guard refuses `sudo` and destructive commands; `SLM_NO_EXEC` plan-only mode.
- No external machine-learning libraries — libc + libm only.
